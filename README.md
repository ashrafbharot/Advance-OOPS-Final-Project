# Advance-OOPS-Final-Project
This repository contains my work on the Emergency Aid Management System, which simulates an assembly line with multiple stations, each responsible for handling specific items in customer orders based on inventory. The project is divided into three milestones to guide the implementation and execution process. In Milestone 1, I implemented the Utilities and Station classes, which laid the groundwork for managing inventory and processing orders. Milestone 2 focused on the CustomerOrder module, enabling the processing of customer requests and tracking item fulfillment. Finally, in Milestone 3, I developed the Workstation and LineManager modules to coordinate order processing and manage the movement of orders across the assembly line. This project was developed using advanced object-oriented programming concepts, helping me understand the complexities of inventory management and order fulfillment in a structured manner.
